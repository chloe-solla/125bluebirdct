<h2>Bio</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/urfin13/art/Chihuahua-merchant-700116515">Artist to Drawing</a></p>
      <p>Hi I’m Chloe and I’m a highschool student in the Bay Area. I chose this as my bio photo because I thought it was hilarious a few months ago. I love learning new things and getting to understand all the bits and pieces about new things, that’s why I’m taking computer science. I hope to enjoy this class and to leave this class with a passion for computer science. Something that I think really makes me me is my siblings and sports. As a middle child I love my little brother and older sister. We both had times where we struggled to get along but as we mature I’ve grown to love them. Another thing that has taught me really important life lessons is my history of sports. I began doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and I’ve transitioned to highschool wrestling and those two sports have taught me nothing but grit and determination. </p>

<h2>Silly Little Project</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/urfin13/art/Chihuahua-merchant-700116515">Cool Super Cool Link</a></p>
      <p>About two winters ago I thought it’d be a great idea to learn how to crochet, especially when we were stuck in quarantine. When experimenting with different needle sizes, techniques, yarn sizes, materials, etc. and a lot of trial and error I was able to make crocheting a little side hustle. I ended up making about $500 over the spring, summer, and fall of 2021 and it was fun learning how to market and edit my own photos. I was able to sell bags and clothing for a decent price but as soon as school started I lacked free time. Every now and then I crochet bags and sell them whenever I have time consuming events like wrestling tournaments or road trips. </p>

<h2>Favorite Scratch Project</h2>
    <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/721865550"> Scratch Project</a></p>
      <p>Although it’s one of my first projects and is pretty simple, it’s special to me because I had a very fun time coding it. When creating it I was getting flashbacks from 5th grade and using Scratch and it was all clicking in my head again. The goal was to just play around and see which block does and to kind of freestyle and it turned out well. I also had a blast inputting my voice into the code and I hope other people got caught by my squirrel jumpscare.

<h2>Favorite Snap Project</h2>
    <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=chloe%2esolla&projectname=Pinwheel%20Part%201">Snap Project</a></p>
      <p>The next project is from Snap. I felt super professional learning how to do this, especially when creating my own variable blocks. The goal was to create a pinwheel and I learned a lot about variable blocks and how to input them. It was very interesting to see how negative and positive and large and small values really changed the outcome of my pinwheel. </p>

<h2>Congressional App Challenge</h2>

      <p>This is a project my teammate Julia and I made in the fall semester of 2022-2023 for the AP computer science class. This was our first ever time creating a complex project on Snap, it was very difficult learning but it was a great experience to learn how to code. </p>
